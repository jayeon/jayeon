I work as a data engineer (mostly to keep my cat well-fed). I'm here to build side projects and learn along the way - usually testing out shiny new tools I barely understand or just trying to find a smarter way to do something. When I'm not building data stuff, you will find me hanging out with my cat or riding my bike on a well-paved trail around Des Moines.
